# Portfolio

## Overview:
The assigned task was to create a web application porfolio using the coding skills gained from class. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my growth as an aspiring web developer and the many projects I have worked on. 

## Functionality
* The following porfolio is able to load and present my personal information, projects, and conact information. 
* The navigation bar succesfully leads the user to the corresponding link on the webpage. 
* When the user has navigated to the work section, they will see a section with titled images of my applications. 
* The large image in the the work section of the portfolio sucessfully leads the user to the project I chose to link to.
* When the user resizes the page or chooses to view the site on verious screens and devices, the webpage successfully adjusts with a responsive layout that adapts to the selected viewport. 


## Progress

Due to my limited knowledge of coding overall, the bare necessities were completed. As I continue in my pursuit of computer knowledge, my original porfolio will lack a lot of creativity and function. 

There are many ideas that I would love to implement in order to improve my porfolio, but I do not know enough code yet to make these ideas possible.
