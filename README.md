# Portfolio

## Overview:
The assigned task was to create a web application porfolio using the coding skills gained from class. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my growth as an aspiring web developer and the many projects I have worked on. 

## Functionality
* The following porfolio is able to load and present my personal information, projects, and conact information. 
* The navigation bar succesfully leads the user to the corresponding section on the webpage. 
* When the user has navigated to the work section, they will see a section with titled images of my applications. 
* When the user is presented to the work applications section, they will see the initial applications image to be larger than the other applications. 
When the user clicks the initial application, they will be taken to that specific deployed application successfully.
* When the user resizes the page or chooses to view the site on various screens and devices, the webpage successfully adjusts with a responsive layout that adapts to the selected viewport. 

## Progress
In its current state, the application successfully fulfills the Acceptance Criteria of the assignment. As I continue in my pursuit of furthering my coding knowledge, my original porfolio will lack many interactives functions and creative aspects. 
At the moment, the portfolio functions in accordance to the required criteria, is prepared for future projects to be attached to the title images, and is able to be viewed live from Github. 

## Future modifications
* Add effects to work images. (Hover effect, opacity adjustment, or javascript when applicable)
* Change work images to appropriate images that represent work. (Or just find more cute dogs doing something related to the project!)
* Improve HTML layout and CSS for a cleaner look.
* Future project (once i've mastered more code): Develop an animated and themed portfolio.
